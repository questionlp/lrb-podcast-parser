        <![CDATA[<p>It’s October, so naturally we’re giving you a Coven (™) episode!

And The Coven (™) actually enjoyed a lot of it! The live shows were a great time and showed off Luke and Andrew’s fun/funny personalities (with a fantastic Nick and Hodgman appearance). The other episodes, filled with tons of Skyjinks Woo (aka man-babies whining about mild discomfort), had us pretty enraged. Ahh the yin and yang of TBTL!</p> <p>Regardless, we are all very excited about what we have brewing for our next iteration. Thank you for the sweet notes, voice memos, and faxes. We love you all!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>It’s getting chilly as we move into fall (unless you live in Texas, I guess), so we’ve built a cotton candy bonfire to warm our hands and hearts while we continue our last few weeks of focusing on TBTL. Your LRB hosts, however, are more interested in dog plans, 20-year-old memories, and the disappointment of Coyote Ugly, among other things. There’s more football talk than usual, given that two of our hosts’ teams are pitted (totally pitted) against one another, and Pinto Ron/Kenny is wasting good condiments left and right. Ann experienced a bizarre non-adventure. Bobby has a problem with certain businessez. Mike is suffering from senioritis. Hillary makes a promise she can’t keep. Plus, the Qatar of celebrities, a level-10 dad joke, never disrespect a book, and the difference between trash talk and trash talk.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Ann and Christy are laughing their way through this final LRB clip show by looking back at some times that people other than us offered up critical feedback for TBTL. But first, we acknowledge that our own responses to judgement from others aren’t always a model of emotional health. We protest the injustice of getting slapped for not following rules we didn’t know existed, or criticized for things we can’t control. We discuss a couple of cases in point, including how Christy’s co-worker accidentally fed her case of impostor syndrome, while Ann once almost had the K-9 unit set on her. Then we dive into clips containing letter-writing grandmas, comparisons of TBTL to athlete’s foot, the creation of a couple of longtime show catchphrases, and a promise from Luke that he will never again make a factual error on the show (hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha). Plus, a Wingdings conspiracy, which cursive capital letters are bs, and the beauty of math. No reply necessary.</p>]]>

Ann, Hillary, Meredith, and Mike are here to talk you through all of that business/nonsense.

We also refuse to quit naming nuts and vow to never ever talk over Marvin Gaye singing!!</p> <p>Most importantly (and sorry to bury the lede), there is some VERY SIGNIFICANT LRB NEWS in the business.

      <itunes:subtitle>There comes a time in a young man’s life when he feels that the entire world is persecuting him. And sometimes that’s accurate, especially when you’re talking about Andrew Walsh and the phenomenon of the cat-roll. From his (supposed) pal Luke, to a dedica</itunes:subtitle>

Lots of questions were asked this week. Is Trump going to win in 2020 (don’t jinx it, Luke!)? Is Luke a hypocrite about his vegetarianism (probably, yes)? Is Andrew wasting his summer (who knows)? Was the octopus lady an irredeemable dummy (according to Mike and the guys, absolutely yes)?</p> <p>As for your lovely hosts, we have a few questions as well. Is Hillary more of a Betty or a Joan (Joan for sure)? Is Adventure Bay the worst run town in all of Canada (uh, yeah)? Should Bobby and Ann go to the Minnesota State Fair together and report back (HELL YES)? Did we go off the rails at the end (maybe!)?</p> <p>Also forward promo for an upcoming show - Mike will tell his hold music-induced panic attack. Stay tuned!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>What a fun time we had in Seattle! Your LRB hosts are (mostly) back home and ready for a post-picnic weekend debrief. We have lots to discuss, including how Hillary is sober on the show for the first time in … a while, what caused Meredith to discover her mom voice, how Ann saved all of LRB from food poisoning, and what we thought of the tricks Mike showed us with a washcloth/towel and a sample size container of L’Occitane lotion. It was less weird than it sounds, honestly. During the TBTL portion of the show, we can’t believe we’re STILL talking about video interpolation, wonder why it matters whose party it is, dubiously discuss the attractiveness of politicians, and sing the praises of Lauren Ober’s appearance on the show. We agree that if you want to be a vegetarian It’s Fine (TM), while disagreeing about a certain Christian worship song. I mean, WE GET IT ALREADY.</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>In our media-obsessed culture, the emphasis on having a trim figure is constant and overwhelming. Almost all of us have been frustrated, at some point, by not being able to achieve the perfect (or, let’s face it, just slightly improved) body, but nobody remains more stubbornly committed to winnowing away those extra pounds than Luke “LB” Burbank. Christy and Ann are ready to do a run-down of many (but certainly not all!) of the fad diets, kooky nutrition ideas, and far-out strategies he’s employed over the years in an effort to build his beef castle. From extreme calorie restriction, to cheeseburgers and booze-ahol, to part-time veganism, he’s willing to try just about anything, although his enthusiasm usually outpaces his preparation. Along the way, we remind ourselves that it’s a “cheat meal,” not a “cheat day,” get annoyed by Bridget Jones’s Diary, and wonder exactly what Luke was doing with those pickles. If you’re interested in reading about the truth of dieting, why it doesn’t actually work, and what you can realistically do to be happy with your body, here’s the book Ann mentioned:  Secrets from the Eating Lab, by Traci Mann, PH.D.</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p class="p1">TBTL may have half-assed Summer Games Week (as well as the pronunciation of chorizo and allium), but Ann, Mike and Bobby are most definitely full-assing this week’s LRB. Bobby just got back from Blue Jays Loonie Dog Night in Toronto, and the Great White North isn’t looking so great these days. Ann is standing ready to rescue her dearest Justin, though he now has competition for her affection from a handsome young new Scottish fellow. And Mike is suffering from a bout of sociopolitical indigestion after the President’s “perp rally,” though a gelatin-suspended seafood sample didn’t help. Plus, a blissfully short breakdown of TBTL’s quizzes, an apropos reminder that  the worst wounds are the emotional ones (with examples!), and an audio postcard from middle-aged transcontinental mom-iish type Hillary, recorded after a harrowing Hungarian pedicab ride.

I’m talking about job interviews, you pervs! The TBTL fellas have a rich history of awkward or embarrassing experiences trying to (or trying not to) get a gig, and have no problems recounting the particulars. Christy and Ann are ready to dig into the details of Luke’s commercial auditions, which provide a motherlode of material, and puzzle over the shady business practices that forced Andrew to tank an interview in beautiful Boise. We also take the opportunity to share some of our own awkward interview experiences, including the time Christy was forced to take a photographic pop culture quiz, and how Ann’s accidental networking triumph spanned three decades, two countries, and two sets of gossipy parents. Feel free to call or text the LRB voicemail at (802) 432-TBTL to share your own interview nightmares (we don’t want to lose the number!).</p>]]>

We also take the opportunity to share some of our own awkward interview experiences, including the time Christy was forced to take a photographic pop culture quiz, and how Ann’s accidental networking triumph spanned three decades, two countries, and two sets of gossipy parents. Feel free to call or text the LRB voicemail at (802) 432-TBTL to share your own interview nightmares (we don’t want to lose the number!).</p>]]>

Mike attended the Austin social event of the year, but he’s subsequently in hot water because Bobby inadvertently “activated a Kramer.” Meredith’s breakfast choice leads to a discussion of ‘morning cheese’. Ann shares why she can never get upset when tv programming is pre-empted for news.

While I think we can agree that all of these things are equally important, our pal Luke has had some trouble keeping track of one of them, so Ann and Christy thought the time was right to revisit some of the times his carelessness got him into travel trouble. From sweet-talking the passport office lady on his wedding day -- dressed in his tuxedo! -- to melting down at the rental car counter in front of national hero Yvonne, Luke’s had his share of self-induced passport emergencies.

        <![CDATA[<p class="p1">Pull up a cushion and feel the rhythm, because Meredith, Ann and Bobby are here to party, and there’s room for one more in this sunken living room of the mind. In addition to a recap of the high notes (and low notes) of last week’s episodes of TBTL, Bobby gives an awkward HR update, Ann gets a cookware anti-intervention, and Meredith shares what it’s like banging with strangers seemingly forever.  And speaking of things that take seemingly forever: Instead of breaking down TBTL Garbage Time, we suggest you check out the new podcast <a href="https://www.minoradventures.com/">Minor Adventures with Topher Grace</a>, or even just these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_L7Ch8Nyrw">Rhode Island recycling videos</a>. Or, just close your eyes, and imagine a certain jogger being chased by some serious off-leash irony.

        <![CDATA[<p>It’s time for another meeting of the LRB coven as Hillary, Meredith, and Ann gather ‘round the cauldron to work our witchy magic. We dial up the feminism this week with discussions about equality in armed service requirements, the problem with the concept of body positivity, and how a touch of toxic masculinity can invade even the most enlightened guys. Additionally, we’ll dig into how urban wild turkeys are no joke, how Luke’s late-night tipping decision was disappointing, and why Terry Gross isn’t the boss of us. In host news, Hillary is kitten-curious, Meredith might be on a Japanese public television show, and Ann is workshopping new LRB taglines. Plus, grumpy-yet-kindhearted Mr. Walsh, our ideas to improve the sport of bowling, and why “the best minds in comedy writing are not working in local news” may be the truest words ever spoken on a podcast.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Hey nerds, geeks, dorks, and dweebs! Join Ann, Hillary, and Mike as we recap this week’s TBTL. We discuss the reveal of the 10th(?) TBTL-a-Thon (aka the worst kept secret), a trip to Oz! Will Luke and Andrew survive a journey through the outback? TBD! Also, your hosts air some personal grievances, including Hillary’s new work nemesis and Ann’s choir enemy. Additionally, Mike schools us on prison electronic usage, Hillary reveals a story about rollerblades that is both embarrassing and completely on brand, and Ann mourns the demise of a potential wedding venue. Take a listen and we promise not to do any April Fools’ Day quizzes, all right? Cool beans!!</p>]]>

Plus, the secondary stamp market, the wonders of General Delivery, our confusion re: current stamp prices, and why don’t you just send Grandma a note once in a while, for God’s sake!</itunes:summary>

After hearing about naked hot tubs, the last Busterblocker, and how Luke “had” to eat meat, we hash through the interesting topics and ask some questions. Is Mt. Constitution really much of a mountain? Why do we assume that body-confident naked guys must be old? Which one of us is willing to sacrifice their body to test driverless cars? As far as our own business goes, we’re working through some exciting new concepts for podcasts that we plan to offer to Jewel Case Media as soon as we’ve gotten caught up on our Nineties movie franchises.

We’re switching up our format a bit, and Luke is realizing that maybe, sometimes? he can be kind-of a jerk. Join the ladies of LRB as they also realize that 1) we can’t go out as late as we once did, 2) houses cost a lot all of the time, 3) celebrities are no better than us, and 4) sometimes we have to bump it up to 2x.</p> <p> We hope you enjoyed the LRB change-up. Let us know what you think!  We promise we will NOT police your tone. #foreplay #politecar</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Well friends, another week of TBTL is on the books, and Hillary, Ann, and Mike are dialing up to get crammed with meditation and break it all down. After a few more inside jokes and a discussion of the finer points of It’s Fine™, we circle back for some raisin TYPs and decide we’re not here to make friends. We’re in total agreement that Luke and Andrew’s embarrassing passive-aggressive behavior is going to lead to one of them getting punched in the head, and that we should study it out regarding the effects of marijuana, but we differ on whether you should treat yo self to some water in the toilet. Hillary’s been folding Star Wars underwear for a thousand years. Mike’s grandfather died in the Storage Wars. And Ann has a connection to a very big Eighties tv star. Plus, Malcolm Gladwell Superiority Complex, why Chris Hayes never skips his A block, and a very slow hoochie cooch from trees.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>On this month’s clip show, Ann, Christy, and “try-hard theater kid” Hillary have brought their tap shoes and jazz hands to talk about the long-standing and somewhat problematic relationship TBTL has with musical theater. We’re pissed off at 2008 Luke’s attitude, but proud of how far he’s come since then. Jen’s star turns at Jesus Creek were continually thwarted by the shortcomings of Eric Trout. We listen to Susie and Luke have a sweet, sentimental conversation about Shirley Temple. And the Stu-bot wants to be in the band. Find out which show Christy loved so much that she carried a token of it for years, what unusual strategy Hillary’s World History teacher employed to contain her enthusiasm, and where to find online footage of the first musical Ann ever starred in (kidding - there is ZERO chance I’m giving up that info). Also on tap for discussion: the Christian kids’ theater industry, real talk about the difficulty of bringing diversity to Broadway, and how we make the argument to haters that musicals aren’t just dumb. Plus, Hamilton spoilers, how to best watch Moulin Rouge, the obvious reason straight guys should love musicals, and safety issues when dancing with bowling balls.</p>]]>

Christy and Ann are ready to share their thoughts on everything from loud ringing bells to NORAD’s Santa Watch. Luke’s obsession with Christmas music leads us into a long discussion of our own likes and dislikes. Jen is once again proven to be our spirit animal. The story of Luke’s first adult Christmas makes us feel warm and fuzzy. Ann spreads a family story that we’re sure her brother will appreciate. Plus, nativity shenanigans, problematic cookie exchanges, and two wonderful traditions in the Wise family. And we discover a shocking fact about Zac Efron that makes us feel better about our impending mortality.</p> <p class="p1">P.S.

        <![CDATA[<p>Ann, Hillary and Meredith are meeting in the LRB conference space, and we DEFINITELY have an agenda, although we’ll need to keep it short so we’re not late for yoga. It was a strange, somewhat gross week of TBTL, full of things in nostrils that shouldn’t be, rambling discussions about “funny” Christian singers, and seriously shady Lyft drivers. We’re head over heels for guest cohost Jeannie Yandel, her awesome podcast, and her attitude toward meetings, agree that Luke should stop trying to ‘cute pic’ Carey into vegetarianism, and take the guys to task for expecting their coworkers to roll with their ineptitude. Hillary reluctantly says that ugly sweater parties are fine™. Meredith needs to replace that bottle of Glenlivet. Ann shares how she took parking lot pedestrian behavior to new levels of passive-aggressiveness. Now if you’ll excuse us, we need to go look up the details of Zach Braff’s life.</p>]]>

We’ve had a lot of fun talking about TBTL, as well as pop culture, sports, candy, pets (new and old), tasty beverages, the state of the world and our own lives. So for this month’s clip show, we’ve decided to take a look back at some of our favorite moments on our own show. Okay, they’re some of Ann’s favorite moments, since this was her idea and she was the one who trawled through the entire year to scoop them up. Listen as we discuss, argue and laugh our way through 2018. We hope you had as much fun listening as we had recording.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to the LRB, friendos – Mike, Meredith, Bobby, and Ann have all survived another Thanksgiving unscathed, and we hope that you have, as well. Our roll holes are stuffed with some sort of carb (with butter, natch), so we’re ready to get down to the business of your latest TBTL recap. On the Burbank family menu this holiday: wet paper bag turkey, garbage bread stuffing, Aunt Mary Lou’s cheese-sprinkled broccoli salad, and potatoes of mysterious production methods. On the host front, Meredith has a dilemma re: some misdirected money. Ann pleads for an end to all the disgusting show topics. Mike’s as real as the poop in the streets. And things are going to start happening to Bobby now. Plus, a fire take on chopsticks, the menace of the Jolly Green Giant, an inside look at pizza conventions, how many people do you need to let the dogs out anyway, and the work of Soup Kitchen Stevens. Parades for everyone!</p> <p>Here’s the episode with Stu telling Mike’s favorite podcast story ever: <a href="http://www.tenseventen.com/show/little-red-bandwagon/lrb-194-recap-not-so-vas-my-friend?rq=194"> #194 (recap): Not So Vas My Friend</a></p>]]>

The reunited I-35 Crew of Ann, Hillary, Meredith and Mike have gathered to make what lemonade we can out of this lemon, even if it means listening to endless talk about vegetarianism, vanilla dairy-free mac and cheese, and unappealing carb substitutes. We dig into the flaw in the premise of “giant bow” car commercials, ponder the hotness level of Beto O’Rourke, thoughtfully discuss the trickiness of trans pronouns, and agree that, despite our civic responsibility, we want no part in the El Chapo trial. Hillary’s ashamed that her knowledge of twins consists of Mary Kate and Ashley references. Mike insists his nickname is El Gaupo (where’s that eye-rolling emoji when you need it?). Ann explains why she doesn’t go to the movies with her mom. Meredith reminds us that kids have been drawing boobs using parentheses for decades. We’re pretty confident that we got this.</p>]]>

Our second-favorite KIRO board op is known for his creative culinary pursuits, and we’re looking back at just a few of the recipes he’s tested out on TBTL. We’ll hear about a heavily modified tuna casserole, dubiously flavored pickles, hotel room hacks that get forced on unsuspecting live show guests, and the questionable decision to introduce an open flame into the workplace. Christy is fleshing out a new conspiracy theory, while Ann makes a shameful food-related confession. Plus, leafy greens, a queso emergency, orange slice candies as a palate cleanser, an act of grocery store thievery, and weird ice cream. Is Sean a flavor visionary or a just a mad experimenter?

        <![CDATA[<p>Over here at the LRB we know that you were promised a handful of special pet-related episodes of TBTL last week. We also know that these promises were poorly fulfilled, as our TBTL friendos proved once again that following a show sheet is not one of their stronger skills. Luckily, your LRB hosts can fill that gap, bringing more pet-related content than all three of TBTL’s Pet-agogy episodes combined (not that it was difficult). Mike is contemplating hair-of-the-dogging-it while his fingers are being decimated (literally) by cat attacks. Ann tells the tale of her self-mutilating hamster before she throws her newly-replaced phone over another mind-boggling Burbank statement. Meredith reflects on the civility of the mosh pit and how her dad got a bad case of prairie dog plague. Also on today’s agenda: secret therapy whispers, the Shaggy Defense, karaoke trapdoors, the problem with fake meat, White Guy Confidant Syndrome, the zucchini measure of friendship, and much more.</p>]]>

There’s a thorough discussion of the new LRB family additions (both cat and human), another emotional breakdown from Mike, a peek at the Van Harn family’s pending super villain, and the continuing countdown to Hillary’s big day (carry me, Daddy!). In fact, we’ve got so much LRB business this week that we barely have time to recap TBTL, but we still manage to share our thoughts on Andrew’s scooter saga, Luke’s potential “house pig,” unnecessary tired weed jokes, and the yelling system. Everyone’s on board as Ann plays all her rage cards simultaneously for the throwiest Throw Your Phone moment ever. Plus, our own unfortunate towing stories, why Diet Coke is the best soda ever, The Good sTens Place, and it’s not Saucy Meat Time. Yet.</p>]]>

Ann and Christy are not exactly style icons, but that doesn’t stop them from digging into a variety of clips that showcase the fashion choices of TBTL’s most image-conscious host. This episode is chock full of Luke’s rules (no shorts on men), boasts (we just don’t understand his fashion acumen), and grievances (clothing stores should only carry stock for the current season). We’ll get to hear the genesis of Operation Fancy Pants, as well as the Jen vs. Luke showdown during the White V-Neck Incident of 2008. And we strongly agree that he wasn’t wearing black socks with white Vans “ironically”. Of course, we have to take little time to talk about our personal fashion philosophies; Christy outlines the history of the mullet, while Ann illustrates the pitfalls of complimenting someone on their appearance in any way. Plus, some unfortunate pants-splitting experiences.</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>Nobody’s attended more TBTL events than Christy (except Luke, I guess), so she and Ann get together for this quick minisode to recap the TBTL Night at the Mariners event from September. Hey, it’s our podcast, so we can post an episode whenever we want! It was an evening full of fun moments, including a hilarious Hanna Brooks Olsen, Luke’s fly dance moves, the pursuit of one of Ellie’s life ambitions, and way too much thinking about Andrew’s tongue. Plus, a kid bathroom emergency, fond(?) remembrances of The Mummy’s antics on the Tour de Terrible, and a discussion of the “living hell” that is curriculum night.</itunes:summary>

Ann, Mike, and Meredith have gathered around the scallop banana hotdish (<em>ick</em>) to rehash the latest in Massholes, our issues with Serial season 3, how many weed lobsters one needs to eat to get high, feline predatory instincts, and plenty of other topics.

First, Mike tells us all about his long-awaited trip back to the Pacific Northwest, including an important lesson he learned about traveling with prosthetics. We dig into a bunch of Throw Your Phone submissions that range from questions about different colors of Twitter, to the rodent-ness of rabbits (and their homicidal tendencies), to the desperate need for the return of the TBTL Science Council, to a delightful fantasy of the LRB coven in action. Then we take a look at all the wonderful, wild, mysterious things you guys have purchased using our Amazon affiliate link: ice makers, dirt bikes, tutus, personal creams (earmuffs, kids!), and lots and lots of turkey stew. Bobby ruins his Amazon search history. Meredith scolds the listeners over some dubious health product purchases. Mike loves infomercials’ “before” footage.

One of the great things about our TBTL friendos is their willingness on a regular basis to dredge up the most unfortunate and cringeworthy things that have happened to them. Many of these stories have been covered on this podcast already, but Ann and Christy have returned with a new crop of tales about interactions, both small and large, that make us nervous and sweaty while listening (usually while hollering, “Luke, noooooooooo!”). We’ve got an unfortunate trilogy of celebrity interactions - one at a bar, one over email, and one involving … puppets. There’s the time Luke commented on something you should never, ever, EVER address with a woman. And, in our “it wasn’t your fault” segment, Jen tells a story about how she was tripped up by inappropriate tipping practices and a nautically-themed restaurant employee. Oh, and you didn’t think we’d do this show without sharing a few embarrassing moments of our own, did you? Christy had a spectacular night at Pride many years ago, while Ann was the cause of another person’s cringey memory.</p>]]>

Many of these stories have been covered on this podcast already, but Ann and Christy have returned with a new crop of tales about interactions, both small and large, that make us nervous and sweaty while listening (usually while hollering, “Luke, noooooooooo!”). We’ve got an unfortunate trilogy of celebrity interactions - one at a bar, one over email, and one involving … puppets. There’s the time Luke commented on something you should never, ever, EVER address with a woman. And, in our “it wasn’t your fault” segment, Jen tells a story about how she was tripped up by inappropriate tipping practices and a nautically-themed restaurant employee. Oh, and you didn’t think we’d do this show without sharing a few embarrassing moments of our own, did you? Christy had a spectacular night at Pride many years ago, while Ann was the cause of another person’s cringey memory.</itunes:summary>

(By the by, Luke, we tend to dislike her for reasons <em>other</em> than that she’s “perfect” and has a good relationship with her ex-husband.) It was kind of a rough week of TBTL, so we have a lot to break down, including whether it’s rude to wear earbuds in a ride share, podcasts as exploitative entertainment vs. worthwhile journalism, the pitfalls of complimenting a woman, and the awful business of collegiate athletics. Plus, burgeoning sympathy for Luke’s educational deficiencies, Andrew’s encroaching old man grumpiness, the three most terrifying words in the workplace, and the parenting cycle continues.</p>]]>

We’ve got a plethora of topics, including duplexing tips from Missy Elliott, new fall menu items for McDonalds, and an existential question about whether life is worth living without the noodles. Bobby ran himself into a froggy state (complete with sound effects), Meredith developed a new criterion for Airbnb reviews, while Ann had a very important houseguest. Plus, getting trapped in Canada, how nasal spray is like love, and French dip snobbery. Bonus: it’s the debut of the LRB Poetry Corner!</p>]]>

But what about the furry friends who came before? Ann and Christy decide it’s high time to take a look back at two TBTL pets of yesteryear: Luke’s cat Pagoda and dog MoMo. We debate whether Pagoda’s dignity is eroded by being forced to use the toilet and then listen to Luke abandon <em>his</em> dignity when he chooses not to. MoMo has some issues (and an affinity for a specific piece of floor covering). Luke is apparently less scary than a Mexican floor installer, but only slightly. As far as our own animals go, Christy has a pet history littered with tragedy, while Ann “trained” an amazing circus hamster. Then we spend way too much time talking about the Empire Today carpet guy and the new computer-generated Peanuts characters. Plus, the eternal wisdom of Bonnie Raitt.</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>Our TBTL friendos spend a lot of time talking about their daily lives, so it’s no surprise that their animals are part of the fabric of the show. But what about the furry friends who came before? Ann and Christy decide it’s high time to take a look back at two TBTL pets of yesteryear: Luke’s cat Pagoda and dog MoMo. We debate whether Pagoda’s dignity is eroded by being forced to use the toilet and then listen to Luke abandon his dignity when he chooses not to. MoMo has some issues (and an affinity for a specific piece of floor covering). Luke is apparently less scary than a Mexican floor installer, but only slightly. As far as our own animals go, Christy has a pet history littered with tragedy, while Ann “trained” an amazing circus hamster. Then we spend way too much time talking about the Empire Today carpet guy and the new computer-generated Peanuts characters. Plus, the eternal wisdom of Bonnie Raitt.</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>On this Final Friday in July, Hillary, Christy, and Ann are getting together to sort through the mailbag, talk about potential Burbank boat names, and discuss a few of our most memorable summer vacations. Some quality Throw Your Phone™ entries from the Wagoneers get us thinking about how Mike has ruined things, planning to ambush Luke with a syringe (it’s for his own good! And listener Scott’s sanity!), and dabbling in unfortunate accents. In vacation talk, Hillary’s semi-wild teenage cruise leaves us questioning her claim of being a goody-goody, Christy has more vacation horror stories than any one person should have, and Ann explains why she hates the Badlands of South Dakota. In camp experiences, one of us lived a teen girl's dream, one of us yearned for something that was not to be, and one of us depended on MTV for her summer entertainment. Plus, a new purpose for some of our Amazon purchase kickbacks, and some very important news about Tate Donovan.</p> <p>Repeat after me: “Charge it to the room.”</p>]]>

We’ve got some decisions to finalize before we gather in Seattle in a few weeks’ time, including the look of the costumes for our upcoming quidditch match at Gas Works Park, and the plan for our Singles tour of Seattle. In this week’s recap of TBTL, we come up with some tips for minimizing on-air allergy noises, figure out how we can qualify for disabled parking placards, and realize why so many breakfast cereals have undergone name changes in the years since our childhoods. Additionally, we discuss ballpark patriotism, how “it’s better than it sounds” is never a ringing endorsement, and how it can be that <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2013/03/take-our-ageless-paul-rudd-quiz.html"> Paul Rudd is not a “weird, cat-faced monster.”</a> Oh, and Luke?

      <itunes:summary>It’s Independence week, and the ladies of LRB are over here just chillin’. We’ve got some decisions to finalize before we gather in Seattle in a few weeks’ time, including the look of the costumes for our upcoming quidditch match at Gas Works Park, and the plan for our Singles tour of Seattle. In this week’s recap of TBTL, we come up with some tips for minimizing on-air allergy noises, figure out how we can qualify for disabled parking placards, and realize why so many breakfast cereals have undergone name changes in the years since our childhoods. Additionally, we discuss ballpark patriotism, how “it’s better than it sounds” is never a ringing endorsement, and how it can be that  Paul Rudd is not a “weird, cat-faced monster.” Oh, and Luke? We love you, but keep your dog on a leash.</itunes:summary>

So, instead of spending much time on Luke’s inexplicable decision to pack only black shirts and Andrew’s steadfast desire to wear pants in the searing southern summer heat, Hillary, Ann and Mike are ready to debate how much moon dust the government actually needs, puzzle over what happens at monster truck shows, and wish a certain public radio personality all the best in his new life with his new bride. Mike has a story of wildlife (and Abbey) running amok at The Ranch. Hillary tells us about her uncomfortable experience watching the movie Parenthood.

Plus, bowling fashion, gutter bumpers, and one of the best listener emails ever.</itunes:summary>
      <itunes:subtitle>The bowling alley is a place that looms large in the minds of our friendos, so Ann and Christy decide it’s time to grab our custom bowling shoes and hipster mustaches, as we take a trip back in time (and cleanliness) to explore TBTL’s love of the good ol’</itunes:subtitle>

        <![CDATA[<p>It’s a Boot the Boys™ episode, so Ann, Meredith and Hillary are gathered at the base of the LRB cheerleading pyramid to plan our latest Mission: Impossible-style caper. But before we put that safety deposit box heist into motion, we need to get into the details of another week of TBTL. Despite some reservations, we whole-heartedly enjoyed our first look at what may potentially be WBUR’s newest smash weekend afternoon program. We have a calm, thoughtful breakdown of the continuing saga of Twitterbeef 2018, ask some follow-up questions concerning the upcoming TBTL: Life is a Highway sure-to-be debacle, and tell the guys to quit crapping all over Common, fer cryin’ out loud. Additionally, we sneak into ATM’s territory for a little advertising critique, cautiously approve of pizza roll grilling, and allow Luke’s misunderstanding of expiration dates to lead us into confessing our own sunscreen shame. Seriously, we’re amazed that Hillary’s nose hasn’t fallen off.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Hey friends, while we were waiting in line behind God for the microwave at the celestial 7-11, the LRB gang decided to make a few changes. So, we’re trying out a new style of recap this week, but don’t give us a Shorty Award just yet. Instead, listen in on a discussion that ranges from a science fiction technology that we think is more important than time travel to the best way to house your bitcoin mining operation. Meredith would rather have a cavity filled than listen to any more from The Rapsures. Mike gets hot under the collar at Luke’s dismissal of marketing professionals. Ann shares tales from the retail trenches that demonstrate why we need rules and policies in the workplace (or maybe just that people are terrible). Plus, radio charlatans, dark chocolate, new standards for insanity in men, and how many rivets should go in the door panel of a Tesla. We’re 112% CA-CAO!</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>Bobby, Ann, Meredith and Mike have assembled to recap the latest week of TBTL, though it’s one of those weeks we’re really not sure why. At least we can all agree that Kiki’s Korner™ is an Instant Klassic™, and her Rosie Perez impression is even better than MIke’s. Plus, Ann is guest-lecturing at No Fun University, Bobby is in DC, Meredith is baffled (acoustically) by cats, and Mike just wanted a trim. Be sure to check out our Sweet 16 candy survey, and  Andrew and Rachel Belle’s “Music is for Girls” playlist, if you’re into that kind of “girl music with wittle baby voices.”</itunes:summary>

And for two guys whose preferred snacks generally involve alcohol and/or bags of farts, Luke and Andrew sure have spent some time talking about sugar. We’re just here to celebrate it, that’s all. From a long conversation about Skittles, to what kind of candy the KKK might pass out, to Luke’s hotel room binges, we’ve got a lot to cover. Further topics of discussion include candy taxonomy, our personal Top Five, successful Marshawn Lynch endorsement deals, and fruit flavor mythbusting.

It took three tries, but we finally got our long-promised email frenzy (Andrew only had to get rid of Luke to do it).

        <![CDATA[<p> It was a long, fun, exhausting weekend in Seattle (the Bay City), so Bobby, Christy, and Ann are gathered to conduct a postmortem on the TBTL 10th  Vanniversary show. We get into all the hijinks that happened before, during, and after, from the pre-show brewery meetup to the post-show karaoke madness and everything in between. Along the way we reflect on the real magic of TBTL: the people we met and the friends we made. We’re not crying, we swear - it’s just raining on our faces. Plus, Christy Has Questions and we need your voicemails!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p class="p1">Like most Tens, Meredith and Mike were on the outside looking in for the 10th Anniversary celebration. But don't worry. They rallied, rented a Dodge Caravan, loaded up a guest host (Mike Farnan) and three angry cats for a rollicking recap of a week low on content but high on anxiety. Grab some chips because beef jerky won't be enough to absorb all of the FOMO. Remember to dab your sneezes and don't let the landlord disturb you, poop shower on your downstairs neighbor's head be damned. And always put your best foot/stump (sorry Frizz) forward when setting up a contest (not a contest) to attract new listeners. M&amp;M&amp;M took a chunk of their weekend to discreetly hand you a thumb drive of LRB and make your Monday almost as satisfying as a deep discount on your IKEA latte.</p> <p class="p1"><em>This TBTL week in review recaps episodes 2555 (listener cover songs, Luke’s stolen backpack, Andrew drank too much, pizza volume problems), 2556 (live show stress, live show prep, Greenlake showers, live show strategy, baby Luke sleeps hooked to a fence), 2557 (meditation apps, commercials, Scotty Brown’s, tip talk, stifling sneezes, baseball cap OPP), 2558 (plumbing problems, cuddling, not-a-contest new listener challenge, slave analogy, pastrami-loving animal doctor), 2559 (What The Hell is TBTL, inside-joke explainers, Susie Burbank’s new podcast “Deal With It”, shame eating). </em></p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Everybody find your cool hat, because we’re heading to a hip party. A dinner party, that is. Ann and Christy dive into some memorable TBTL clips concerning awkward dinner parties, including a truly cringe-inducing Jen Andrews story where we try to decide whether Jason is the hero or the villain, a typically Burbankian spur-of-the-moment plan that has some unforeseen complications, a strange brag that has everyone (involved!) scratching their heads, and a fantastic story from listener Sam of what turns out to be a dinner party of a different sort. Plus, we share the perils of having a super social partner, secret weapons to get out of an awkward situation, a story of an uncomfortable encounter with an Italian man (not the good kind), and how we learned that Yemen is a country. And while it may seem otherwise, we really are having a good time at your party - we’ll just be over in the corner, not talking.</p> <p>Youthful Burbank out!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p class="p1">It may be 2018, but LRB’s year-end navel-gazing needed a little more time thanks to listeners (and Ann) suggesting so many great clips. Join Mike and Bobby as we explore a loose theme of “girls rule, boys drool,” not by design, but just because that’s what the evidence bears out. The LRB ladies defend science and decency; Mike opens meat with sewing scissors and inadvertently wins (or, loses) a wet white-shorts contest. And as a bonus, a time Bobby got put through an emotional wringer. But at least no one has chlamydia!</p>]]>

Ann is back from LA, and successfully avoided taking a bite of her adorable nephew who definitely isn’t a corndog.

        <![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the spirit of TBTL’s ending the year with an airing of personal regrets, we thought we’d join in! But then we remembered that we don’t have any regrets. So instead, here’s one of our favorite clip shows from 2017 all about times when our usually lovable TBTL hosts let the Big Dog out, with plenty of regret to go around. Enjoy!</p> <p class="p1">Our original synopsis from July 21, 2017:</p> <p class="p1">#239: Fifty cents and a frowny face</p> <p class="p1">Step on up to the bar, order a shot and a beer from the tough-as-nails lady wearing the cat sweatshirt, and get ready to embrace your rage, because this month’s clip show is all about the Big Dog. Luke is famous for his temper, so Ann and Christy are here to share some memorable TBTL times when things got … a little heated. Mostly, we try to answer the question, ‘Is Luke a jerk, or the best friend ever?’ Along the way, we break down the original Big Dog story, critique Andrew’s handling of a difficult bartender, and agree that Luke will probably never get a job with the Seattle Bureau of Tourism. Plus, Christy’s dad started an “extreme counseling” business (it involves non-contact taekwondo), and it’s kind of awesome. Here’s a handy list of what we learned:</p> <p class="p1">1) It’s probably not about you</p> <p class="p1">2) When The Mummy is the voice of reason, something has gone terribly wrong</p> <p class="p1">3) Don’t awaken Christy’s righteous fury unless you want your tires slashed</p> <p class="p1">4) NEVER TOUCH THE BOUNCER</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Happy Thanksgiving, Wagoneers! You’re all welcome around our post-holiday table, even if you think casseroles are gross and you’re afraid to eat the onion ice cream. Pull a bag of jerky out of your fanny pack and we’ll get down to business; just don’t accept a cup of Kryptonite coffee from Meredith, okay? Luke’s been skateboarding in the airport. Again. Is it bad of us to be hoping, at this point, for a small disaster? We discuss TBTL’s participation in this year’s Podcrawl, and one of us has a surprising depth of knowledge about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Additionally, Mama Stamberg’s cranberry relish undergoes the LRB test, we agree that Andrew probably shouldn’t call himself The Bone Collector (seriously, have you seen the movie??), and then wonder how long it might be until Luke’s scalp falls off due to his laser baldness products. In host news, Mike’s going after Big Pharma to the tune of one hundo a day, five hundo a week. Meredith shares a cat fact that will melt your heart. Ann wants everyone to listen to <a href="https://donedisappearedwithmejohndavidbooter.com/">Done Disappeared: A True Crime Podcast by John David Booter</a> immediately. Just do it, okay?

        <![CDATA[<p>“This is what happens when I do this on Percocet.” –Christy Wise</p> <p>Our TBTL friends spend so much time telling “hot dog stories” that we decided it’s high time to talk about the actual thing, and thus we bring you a show with stories about hot dogs. First, we talk about our own relationship with encased protein products: when vegetarian Christy gets drunk, her evening often includes “street meats”, while Ann is philosophically opposed to “roller meats”. Luke once made a terrible drunken decision at the Hollywood Park Casino, which leads to a somewhat disturbing conversation about floor food in the restaurant industry. Andrew tells the original hot dog story, which isn’t as long as we remembered. We discuss possible shape re-designs for child choking hazards and plot a possible takeover of Big Bun. Somewhat ironically, our show about hot dogs is full of hot dog story-type tangents. We end up talking about surprise bra snacks, canned pasta-influenced shameber foods, The Mummy’s possible arrest record, Skittles, the ongoing allure of the Ryan Gosling movie Drive, and childhood babysitter trauma (Stephanie knows what she did).</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>It’s Franzia Friday at the Little Red Bandwagon, as Brooklyn Ten Felicia Powell joins Ann and Meredith to talk about everything from politics to local bovine news coverage.  Felicia shares how she got bait-and-switched into the world of TBTL, and why she wrote an email to them that continues to have a big impact to this day. Plus, she teaches us an important fact about our constitutional right (or lack thereof) to vote. Then we refill our wine glasses and listen back to the time Jen convinced Luke and Andrew to try recreating the 4th Hour of NBC’s Today Show without ever having watched it. Luke makes a disturbingly convincing Kathie Lee Gifford, while Andrew’s best attempts to produce competent segments only serve to highlight his endearing cluelessness. If we all agree on one thing, though, it’s that Usher is totally dreamy.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>It’s Franzia Friday at the Little Red Bandwagon, as Brooklyn Ten Felicia Powell joins Ann and Meredith to talk about everything from politics to local bovine news coverage.  Felicia shares how she got bait-and-switched into the world of TBTL, and why she wrote an email to them that continues to have a big impact to this day. Plus, she teaches us an important fact about our constitutional right (or lack thereof) to vote. Then we refill our wine glasses and listen back to the time Jen convinced Luke and Andrew to try recreating the 4th Hour of NBC’s Today Show without ever having watched it. Luke makes a disturbingly convincing Kathie Lee Gifford, while Andrew’s best attempts to produce competent segments only serve to highlight his endearing cluelessness. If we all agree on one thing, though, it’s that Usher is totally dreamy.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Hey, can we buy you a shot? How about you? C’mon, have one with us! On this month’s clip show, the topic is the intersection of TBTL and alcohol (let’s call it Part One of a multi-part series…). Here to guide you on this voyage of discovery are Christy and Ann, who are perhaps the two members of the LRB crew least qualified to talk about the subject. Regardless, we shake our heads over the time Luke did a swan dive off the little red wagon, debate attending a hipster bouncy house party, discuss being faced with a shockingly high bar tab, and ponder whether we would eat the pickle (NOT a euphemism). Plus, Christy may be responsible for Luke’s infamous nose injury, and Ann naively thought that casinos would be closed on high holy holidays. Oh, and we make a firm statement that it’s perfectly acceptable to disappear if The Mummy tries to boner roll you.</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>Bobby, Ann and Meredith have finished sorting the human, dog and floor towels (don’t ask about the hand towels) and are more or less ready for your latest TBTL Week in Review. Although, honestly, Bobby is losing his voice, Ann is full of cinnamon rolls (“they’re not poison”), and Meredith is reflecting on “a sad song about municipal failures.” Looking on the bright side, we have four-week-old Wagoneer Brennan’s TBTL/LRB Top Ten List! And also, apparently Houston is fixed? It’s not too late to sign up to play TBTL Bingo! Email tbtlbingo@gmail.com to get your bingo card now.</itunes:summary>

After Mike and Bob compare their summers (Bob’s was better), we hold the ceremonial unboxing of a Wagon Full of Loot. Then, we dive into the recap of last week’s TBTL, which may or may not have been swass, depending on which definition you want to use. We come up with a new, more useful hurricane-naming system, introduce a new segment called, “Old Man Stein Yells at Clouds”, and elaborate on the perils of telling someone they look like Bobby Hill. Mike knows the real reason we hit the snooze button on World War III, and Ann is forced to use the term “fecal material” far too many times. Plus, Bob floats an Up with People conspiracy theory for the ages.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In this month’s clip show, Ann and Christy are back for a second round of the TBTL terms and phrases that captured our imaginations over the years. Along the way we discuss mid-nineties nautical movies, the story of Christy’s very own Overboard cruise experience, ways to tell your friends and family you’re having digestion issues, the best unit of time ever, how Luke invented a word (no, not ‘gaymazing’), and take a detour into a discussion about the MochaLatta Chill. Some of these terms even affected our lives: a TBTL vocabulary mystery helped Christy solve a problem at work, and the show has been a primer on functional alcoholism for Ann. Plus, we expand our knowledge of the Jerkington family tree. Be sure to listen all the way to the end of the show to find out whether Ann fires Christy.</p> <p>P.S. In case you wanted to know, Alec Baldwin’s three hopes for 2009 were: 1) Slumdog Millionaire wins the Oscar, 2) the auto industry continues to work on fuel efficient cars, 3) there won’t be a SAG strike.</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>Special guest and lady social-scientist Ellen “Kenny G” Middaugh returns (see ep. 193) to help Bobby, Meredith and Ann break down the latest week of TBTL from Bud Light to bird feeder, and every disgusting and insecurity-laden step between. Ann pilots the Millennial Falcon through a Kessler Run of corrections, Meredith brings  the facts on pesticides and silk pillowcases, Bobby made his very own batch of Ooey Gooey Tar Bars thanks to a recipe from Ann’s Aunt Carroll, and Ellen doesn’t hate when Andrew jacks up the reverb, but we let her stay anyway. (One thing we do all agree on? The more Carey Burbank on TBTL, the better.) Plus, another anecdote about why plungers should be mandatory, and the surprisingly Southern sound of Ann’s sensibilities being shaken.</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>Our show plan for this episode was foiled by the whims of a US government agency, so Ann, Christy, and Bobby decide to take some time to design a new LRB game/contest. Hey, if Luke and Andrew can do show planning “on-air”, so can we. Get your daubers out, because we’re playing bingo! TBTL bingo, that is. Everyone’s welcome to play – just send an email to tbtlbingo@gmail.com and you’re in like Flynn. In true crowdsourcing fashion, we want Wagoneer input on which TBTL terms, phrases, or concepts should get a square, so hit us up with your ideas. This is going to be fun: imagine listening to TBTL and crossing your fingers in the hope that Luke will talk about his diet grind, because it’s THE LAST SQUARE you need (kidding – you know we’re going to fill in that square during the first five minutes of the Monday show, right?).</p> <p>Additionally, we finally take some time to examine our Amazon purchases list with the care and attention it deserves. You guys have been buying some seriously interesting stuff, and we want to celebrate your interests and take a tiny peek into your (safely anonymized) lives. As always, our heartfelt thanks go to everyone who supports us by using our Amazon affiliate link when purchasing things from The Company Slowly Taking Over The World.

Despite all the traveling we’ve done recently, we’re confident that nobody on this podcast rode their skateboard through the Haggens’ parking lot, or got crunched by a seat recliner on the plane, or took out a planter with their vehicle (actually, scratch that last one).  We’ve got your latest TBTL week in review, and boy, do we have questions. Ann wants to know if men are really that afraid of getting in trouble with their partner, Mike wants to know the mechanics of butt-dialing someone, and Meredith wants to know how long she’s going to have to continue defending ICP. In addition to addressing these important queries, we discuss parking in Texas, puzzle over whether tonight pants are for sleeping in, and plan an extravagant Chick-fil-A/hotdog bar wedding. And Mike makes a shocking scissors-related confession.</p>]]>

Between the community chop saw, fast food marketing talk and some dirty clown love (f—ing stereotypes, how do they work?) this episode has something for everyone.</p> <p class="p1">Special thanks to Bailey (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/rippletale/">rippletale on Instagram</a>) for lending us her artistic talent for this episode’s amazing (and copyright-free) show drawing. And also to guest engineer Aidan on the ones and twos for not only keeping us rolling and apologizing (#sorryaidan), but also for <a href="https://youtu.be/sFz82JeQmS0">putting together a video of our recording session</a>. (It’s amazing how far these kids have come despite having Will for a father.)</p>]]>

Okay, okay, we can’t tell you the topic of this show, but we can give you a preview of just a few of the things Christy and Ann talk about in it. There’s an extended conversation about the sexiness (or not) of Kevin Costner. Also, a reference to a “river of cheese thoughts”, an earnest desire to try space fajitas, and the question of whether men and women are equally insane. And Ann finally has her wish granted. You might CATCH yourself laughing along with us; we certainly hope it won’t SNORE you to tears.</p>]]>

Luke made the false assumption that you can have too many desserts at a potluck, Andrew made the false assumption that everyone will appreciate medium rare burgers at his cookout, and we made the false assumption that the guys wouldn’t need to spend 20 minutes talking about the alphabet when coming up with this year’s TBTL picnic food assignments. Additional topics on today’s show: pronunciation hypocrisy, what the actual purpose of the driverless car study was, the problems with living in a lighthouse on Lake Huron during the winter, and the atrocity committed by Meredith’s onetime dinner guest on a perfectly good piece of meat.

Even though Luke’s on vacation, a week of delightful guest hosts and great content has left Bobby, Meredith, and Ann with more put-ups than we know what to do with. We try to figure out if someone’s trolling Andrew over the Wallingford Parking Wars (it wasn’t us, honest!), take a surprisingly melancholy walk down memory lane, and ponder whose job it should have been to tell Michael Jordan he needed to lose the Hitler mustache. We also share our answers for this week’s Questions of the Day, including a heaping helping of Sandwich Talk and which chores we want our genie-wizard to take off our hands. In LRB host news, Bobby’s up in Canada developing his new podcast <em>BrockMore</em> (about the Hank Azaria series <em>Brockmire</em>), Meredith’s back from crisscrossing the country to visit her old stomping grounds, and Ann’s preparing her Frank Sinatra Filibuster, which is not a dessert, but sounds like it should be. Speaking of dessert, stick around to the end of the show to hear us mount a defense of the perfect pie.</p>]]>

Over at LRB Studios, we’re lovingly cradling the shattered remains of our thrown phones as we shed a tear over the apparent disappearance of basic science education. Some doughnuts would make us feel better, but Edith ate them all, so instead you can join us on the porch for some peanuts in the shell washed down with a delicious bacteria frappe. In addition to setting up future guest speakers for the Ex-Con Con, Mike’s seriously running out of patience for airplane talk, and Ann had a mysterious medical issue she wants to talk over with Meredith. Plus, tips on how to beat someone with your junk and a discussion of the wonders of Xanax. You’re more than just a truck friend to us.</p>]]>

In addition to setting up future guest speakers for the Ex-Con Con, Mike’s seriously running out of patience for airplane talk, and Ann had a mysterious medical issue she wants to talk over with Meredith. Plus, tips on how to beat someone with your junk and a discussion of the wonders of Xanax. You’re more than just a truck friend to us.</p>]]>

This week Phyllis reports live from Lopez Island, just across from Mike Frizzell's ancestral plot on Mud Bay.

        <![CDATA[<p>Hi, pod friendos! Welcome to LRB HQ – doesn’t the yard look great? Since we’re all a bunch of desk monkeys, we had a couple of buff dudes take care of the landscaping. Pull up a chair and make yourself comfortable as Mike, Meredith, and Ann recap last week’s TBTL. We’ve got a couple of drinks we can offer – would you prefer a $9 glass of sugar, or a shot of whiskey? (If you’re real nice, we might be able to rustle up an old toe to drop in there.) Feel free to use any bathroom you like: to us, you’re a first-class person, no matter what the airlines say. On today’s episode, Mike teaches us about cultural differences in baseball celebrating, Meredith has a very naughty dog, and Ann is literally podcasting in the dark. You may have to raise your voice a little because of the Mariachi band, but we’re confident our walk-up music is the best.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p class="p1">Hold the podcatcher! Bobby, Ann and Meredith just got off a connecting episode, and refuse to look stupid running across the Zune Marketplace to make it to your latest TBTL Week in Review on time. If we get stuck, we might have to drive a fartlocker full of smoked meats and roasted kale to you, or worse—fly coach. With our luck we’ll end up in a middle seat between two fidget spinner-ers.  If you want to Eagle Soar (Sore?) with Luke, you can find him on Facebook this week. Or, you can cash me outside raiding Andy’s pecan-heavy Snack Drawer and watching the latest episode of Rosetta &amp; Stone. It’s not great, but it’s better than the theme song to the Rockford Files.  Speaking of theme songs, remember the time <a href="https://www.apmpodcasts.org/tbtl/2011/06/why-it-matters-tv-theme-songs/"> TBTL did an episode about Why They Matter</a>? Professional Storyteller Luke sure didn’t.  Oh, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393254224/?tag=tenseventen04-20"> buy Chris Hayes’ book</a>, and read it.

Mike, Ann and Meredith are ready to inflate the LRB hot air balloon and try to sneak up on those runaway turtles. Mike abandons any pretense of neighborliness as he asserts his sandwich rights, Ann inexplicably talks about tree cancer, and we want you to visit Meredith’s mom’s Etsy store for her Starburst wrapper crafts. After a healthy debate, we agree that Andrew would pulverize Luke in a fight, we disagree about the merits of a segment based around Gmail responses, and someone shares a real-world example that illustrates why, when packing underwear, you always count your days and then add one. Stick around for the end of the show, when Ann and Meredith gently guide Old Man Frizzell through his cleverly coded notes.

        <![CDATA[<p class="p1">Grosse Pointe Ten Sydney McIlroy joins Meredith and Bobby to listen back to the time Dr. Jerkington III—a proud alum of Judgement Tech—called Jen Andrews’ beloved Mr. Knightly “fat.” (He may have been right; he was still a jerk.) We also talk about our own pets, and piece together memories formed between stiff drinks at the St. Paul live show. Speaking of stiff, we’re confident you’ll like this episode at least as much as Eddie likes a good bull penis.  <em>This episode features a clip from</em> <a href="https://archive.org/details/TBTL.APR.2008/APR.03.2008.HR3.mp3"> <em>Hour 3</em></a> <em>of the April 3, 2008, episode of TBTL.</em></p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Psst! Get your lab coats and safety goggles, and don’t let Mike know where you’re going, because Meredith and Ann are stepping into the LRB lab to bring you a clip show all about TBTL and science. First, we talk about how we became scientists, what exactly we do for our jobs (because let’s face it, it’s kind of complicated and everybody’s too scared to ask), and what kind of challenges we face as women in science. Then we delve into some clips of our TBTL friendos dipping their toes into the world of studies, sample sizes, and experimental design. Jen and Luke can’t believe the things Canadians want to study, but we think they’re kinda missing the point. A crazy British scientist says we don’t need to bathe; Ann thinks you should never maintain the same hygiene level as The Mummy. Luke and Andrew are at odds over the restorative power of a nature walk. And a man with an unfortunate medical condition leads Meredith to ponder “all the things we do to allow men with no boners to have boners.”</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Today, Mike and Ann welcome guest host and Tube Full of Loot™ winner Naomi Hillyard on the third mic to talk tattoos, cults, and our honest opinion of Shirley Temple’s talent. We cover a veritable buffet of TBTL topics, including a battle for supremacy between candy-colored coffee drinks, whether preparing a frozen lasagna after eating a burger should really qualify as shame-eating or something else entirely (still shameful, mind you), and what's reasonable to expect your loved ones to do with your remains. Plus, Ann begs for an end to KFC Colonel talk, Mike shakes his head at the irony of Andrew correcting anybody on sports terminology, and Naomi offers a safe space for the karaoke-curious. And before we begin, let us remind you that you can use the safe word at any time.</p>]]>

We cover a veritable buffet of TBTL topics, including a battle for supremacy between candy-colored coffee drinks, whether preparing a frozen lasagna after eating a burger should really qualify as shame-eating or something else entirely (still shameful, mind you), and what's reasonable to expect your loved ones to do with your remains. Plus, Ann begs for an end to KFC Colonel talk, Mike shakes his head at the irony of Andrew correcting anybody on sports terminology, and Naomi offers a safe space for the karaoke-curious. And before we begin, let us remind you that you can use the safe word at any time.</p>]]>

Ann and Christy, along with Very Special Guest Mansplainer Bob Stein, are here to take on TBTL’s occasional treatment of lady issues. We catch up with what’s been happening in Bob’s life since the last time he joined us on LRB (Episode #91: Casserole Playing), consider how we feel about the One and a Half Men segment in general, and then dig into some clips. Are men the cause of most of women’s problems? When does persistence become harassment? Is it ever okay to accuse a woman of being emotional? (Hint: NO.) We evaluate the guys’ approaches and attitudes towards thorny problems that they’re completely unqualified to discuss, cheer on their feminist sympathies, and roll our eyes as needed. Plus, we share our own stories of getting emotional in the workplace and come up with an early contender for Song of the Summer. Remember, guys: don’t email Andrew until we say it’s time!</p> <p>This show contains clips from the following TBTL episodes: 4/3/12 (lady television shows, Lee Aronsohn, sexism, On Our Media); 5/8/12 (going without makeup, AnnaLynne McCord, vanity); 4/7/14 (Dianne Feinstein, getting emotional, gendered insults, crying at work); 3/12/15 (persistence and consent, dating, YouTube, Doe Eyes, imperfect messenger, male entitlement).</p>]]>

And in case you missed it, a guy got forcibly dragged off an airplane last week.   Here’s a TV segment about the Nordic Lodge.</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>Hi, stranger. Last week things got a little strained in the TBTL-verse, but we’ll always make room for you on the LRB escalator! Come and join the conversation riot with Mike, Meredith, and Ann as we break down The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly &amp; Extremely Upsetting. We’re talking taxes, T-rexes, S-Bux(es) and more. Things you need to know: smoking some Chris Haze will not help you understand Chris Hayes, “cream and dream” may have worked as a lyric in the 1960s but it’s problematic now, and you’re not as funny as you think you are (even you, Mike). Plus, tattoo lookouts, how to fall in love with baseball, and dog talk galore.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>This week, we’re all heroes at LRB. Mike saved his family from conflict by sharing a heartfelt moment, even if it was only because his wires were tapped. Ann brazenly rejects the idea of “Gleeification,” despite only being our third-favorite babysitter. And Bobby offers to put his life and body on the line to settle whether or not Taco John’s is any good—if you’ll pay for the trip. And on top of all of that, we take time off from our important work to recap the latest week of TBTL. So join us as we climb the pyramid of deliciousness all the way to its pork peak, and feast on an idealized Dagwood from our favorite Mongolian Quiznos. It’s sure to make for some exciting at-plates. </p> <p>Be sure to check out <a href="http://seattle.curbed.com/2016/6/27/12044588/restored-1918-colonial-revival-burien-bean-gene-baxter">Bean Baxter's ridiculously adorable old house</a>, and the <a href="http://www.langhamhotels.com/en/the-langham/boston/dining/chocolate-bar/">chocolate buffet at the Langham in Boston</a>.</p>]]>

Ann brazenly rejects the idea of “Gleeification,” despite only being our third-favorite babysitter. And Bobby offers to put his life and body on the line to settle whether or not Taco John’s is any good—if you’ll pay for the trip. And on top of all of that, we take time off from our important work to recap the latest week of TBTL. So join us as we climb the pyramid of deliciousness all the way to its pork peak, and feast on an idealized Dagwood from our favorite Mongolian Quiznos. It’s sure to make for some exciting at-plates. </p> <p>Be sure to check out <a href="http://seattle.curbed.com/2016/6/27/12044588/restored-1918-colonial-revival-burien-bean-gene-baxter">Bean Baxter's ridiculously adorable old house</a>, and the <a href="http://www.langhamhotels.com/en/the-langham/boston/dining/chocolate-bar/">chocolate buffet at the Langham in Boston</a>.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>This week, Mike and Ann are joined by Sarah Mulrooney, proud BosTen, shaper of young minds, and someone who likes a nice bottle of Pinot Grigio. Mike repurposes an old game for a round of Make Sarah Mad, Ann has questions about culinary offerings at boarding schools, and Sarah shares the time she got into a Facebook beef with Luke. Then we go back to the “Saddest Day in TBTL History” and listen to Luke telling the Tens about his break up with Vanessa. It sounds like a downer, but we embrace the emotion and have a long talk about finding the courage to end something that you know isn’t working. Don’t skip this one, guys.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p class="p1">Based on Luke’s holiday accent and the sharp spike in the number of phone-throwings lately, it seems the Luck o’ the Irish has been too busy partying every weekend to grace us. But have no fear: Bobby, Ann, and special guest co-host Mike Farnan (i.e. the new and improved, two-legged Mike) are here to navigate this not-technically-a-blimp through your frustration, patch up any rough spots with red duct tape, and whisper in your ear (non-sexually, of course) why you’ve been listening to TBTL all this time. And we even get right down to business—no Maddow-sweeping the quarter-hour here!</p> <p class="p1">All that plus a recap of this week’s shows (Girl Scouts! Boner pills! ASMR! … Not all at once!) and Mike opens his WAGON FULL OF LOOT LIVE, and it’s almost as awe-inspiring as Milton Berle’s junk. Almost.</p> <p class="p1">When you’re done, check out this <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/29/a-new-generation-of-airships-is-born"> article on blimps from the New Yorker</a>, and this great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcbj8BBsWSA">Key &amp; Peele</a> sketch, both mentioned by Mike. We should all be more like Mike.</p> <p class="p1"><em>This episode recaps TBTL episodes 2335 (Wallingford Wurst, headaches, St. Patrick’s Day, spelling bee, Girl Scout cookies, Vanilla Ice), 2336 (Techno geeks drop, CIA hacking, St. Patrick’s Day), Viagra, Goodyear blimp, Johnny Depp), 2337 (Eagles, Diana Ross, Technotronics Technogeek with Spreadshee, DashLane, Maddow, BBC interview, Luke’s Irish impression, ASMR), 2338 (Eagles, Fast and the Furriest, McDonald’s tweet, Julian Assange, Nielsen ratings), 2339 (ASMR, Smashmouth All Star, Milton Berle, Mutley, white noise, Richard Simmons podcast, housekeeping.)</em></p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Our pal Luke: charming, witty, fun, and ever-so-slightly unethical. From his intense desire for Charleston Chews and his childhood pal Aaron’s “muscle pullover hoodie” to helping himself to unpaid-for fast food lemonade, Luke’s always willing to share his experiences with minor larceny. And so, to celebrate these trivial transgressions, Christy and Ann are here to bring you a collection of TBTL clips about petty theft in the TBTL universe. In addition to Luke’s antics, we cover Jen’s story of a nefarious yard gnome theft ring and debate strategies for minimizing vehicular property damage. Plus, stories of our own petty thefts (and you thought we were such angels!).  FYI: The app Christy mentioned in the show for helping figure out when to go to the bathroom during movies is called "RunPee" and you can find it at <a href="http://www.RunPee.com">www.RunPee.com</a> </p>]]>

Our breakdown of last week’s shows includes agreeing that Luke’s pushing the bounds of the concept of the late checkout, deciding that you’re not a “cat person” until you get that third cat, and a refusal (mostly) to continue hashing out The Great Phone Incident of 2017. Also in the hopper: we talk about our own small anxieties at the gas station, the produce section, and the checkout counter.

They discuss the meaning behind teenage Andrew’s visit to his driving instructor’s apartment, share some close calls (with good and bad outcomes) regarding bathroom emergencies, and try to separate the George Michaels from the George Michaelses. While they have slightly differing opinions about Valentine’s Day, they’re in complete agreement that under no circumstances should Luke be allowed to take flying lessons. Additionally, Meredith tells us about the disease with the best/worst name ever, Ann silently cringes as the other two discuss something they refer to as a “space turd grabber”, and Mike is excited for Luke to get his Light Phone, if only for the rich vein of mockery he can mine. Oh, and if we can’t get a plane home from Portland, we’ll be sure to stay at the Hotel Deluxe, because “this is how a hotel treats a VIP customer.”</p>]]>

Special guest co-host Steve “Stu” “StuBot” “Chris Hayes Follows Me on Twitter” Neuman joins Bobby and Mike to recap the latest week of TBTL, and to update us all on recent news in his life both professional and anatomical. It turns out, the only path more treacherous than the one down Alabama Hill this week is the one to Stu’s vas deferens.

The clip, from <a href="http://www.infiniteguest.org/tbtl/2014/10/dont-be-a-dombass/">October 24, 2014</a>, comes from the same episode as Luke’s legendary dombass note (as we’ve <a href="http://www.tenseventen.com/show/little-red-bandwagon/episode-157">previously covered with Phyllis</a>). Overall the episode is an embarrassment of riches, unlike Luke’s old classmate Brendan Boyd, who is just an embarrassment.</p> <p>Silver Lining Alert: Luke’s impression of Kai Ryssdal gives Ann and Ellen a chance to share a Whole Lotta Love for their favorite “voice crush,” who is still on Ann’s laminated list even though he’s traded in his convertible and Navy uniform for a workhorse minivan.

Meredith and Phyllis join their host Christy who guides us through some genuine girl talk: Phyllis and phriends lose 1,000 lbs during the Trump administration, and Meredith prepares to be the belle of the real-life ball. Then we go back in time to the waning radio days of TBTL when Luke and Jen announce what not to do on a live national broadcast when you're interviewing a trauma survivor. We get On Our Media and give you news you probably can't use on this week's Little Red Bandwagon. All that, and we congratulate our first monthly Wagons Full of Loot winner!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Welcome, friendos! The political landscape may have shifted, but TBTL continues, and that means LRB is here to break it down. In your weekly recap, Mike, Meredith, and Ann puzzle over exactly what it means that Andrew’s been meeting “old colleagues” for lunch, reflect on how Carey’s becoming a true Burbank, (although her desire to follow rules and regulations is driving her husband crazy), and dissect Luke’s trolling of the Canadian Border Patrol, which makes Carey, Andrew (and frankly all of us) extremely nervous. Additionally, Luke strives for an advantage in the parking ticket arms race, Andrew doesn’t understand why he can’t find eggnog for purchase in January, and we learn that TBTL has a new supervisor. Welcome, and we hope you’re not listening.</p> <p>Along with all this week’s hot takes, Meredith shares how her tiny fence experience was a little more than she bargained for, Ann wants a moratorium on the phrase “on the nose,” (unless it refers to Luke’s dermatological issues) and Mike explains the concept of “sheet nipples." Plus, Simpsons Watch is a go, plans for the LRB slanket are being finalized (not really), and we’re busy creating an LRB raffle prize box that’ll give you the true, authentic aroma of Kyle, TX. Oh, and sorry about that whole Putin/Seagal imagery thing... we can’t get it out of our heads, either.</p>]]>

In your weekly recap, Mike, Meredith, and Ann puzzle over exactly what it means that Andrew’s been meeting “old colleagues” for lunch, reflect on how Carey’s becoming a true Burbank, (although her desire to follow rules and regulations is driving her husband crazy), and dissect Luke’s trolling of the Canadian Border Patrol, which makes Carey, Andrew (and frankly all of us) extremely nervous. Additionally, Luke strives for an advantage in the parking ticket arms race, Andrew doesn’t understand why he can’t find eggnog for purchase in January, and we learn that TBTL has a new supervisor. Welcome, and we hope you’re not listening. Along with all this week’s hot takes, Meredith shares how her tiny fence experience was a little more than she bargained for, Ann wants a moratorium on the phrase “on the nose,” (unless it refers to Luke’s dermatological issues) and Mike explains the concept of “sheet nipples." Plus, Simpsons Watch is a go, plans for the LRB slanket are being finalized (not really), and we’re busy creating an LRB raffle prize box that’ll give you the true, authentic aroma of Kyle, TX. Oh, and sorry about that whole Putin/Seagal imagery thing... we can’t get it out of our heads, either.</itunes:summary>

Luke is causing trouble in his marriage due to his ongoing affair with technology, as well as working up some pre-emptive indignation at the tickets he’s surely going to get for parking illegally in Walshworld. Andrew and his pink ink notes (they’re friendly!) have been experiencing some episodes of rage, but we should be all right, as long as he keeps a lid on his manberry pudding pack. Err, his Saint-Tropez truffle duffle. I mean, his budgie smuggler.</p> <p>On the homefront, we have lots of new things gearing up, including a call to action for the Wagoneers and a new contest. Mike details his new policy for picture messaging him, Meredith explains what it means that she’s hosting a Tiny Fence ConcertTM, and Ann wants everybody to stop bitching about how cold they are, because she’s colder, dammit.</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>Happy New Year from Little Red Bandwagon! Slip past the kid at the door and grab any open seat to hear Meredith, Mike and Bobby recap the latest week of TBTL, because it’s not stealing if it was going to be empty anyway. We promise not to tell, especially because Bobby is too busy breaking in his Instant Pot, Mike is too busy watching a kitten antagonize a bunny, and Meredith is too busy running the numbers on how many celebrities died last year. (Hot Take: They’re probably not going to stop in 2017.) Please just make sure to keep the lights on for Duff, keep your mouth shut about the new shower head, check out  Andrew’s new mixtape, and (literally) phone it in for any potential new listeners. They’ll love that. (The part you want starts at 0:26.)</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p class="p1">Luke may have talked his way out onto international waters, but that won’t stop Bobby, Ann and Meredith (along with their fully intact lawn furniture) from talking through the latest week of TBTL. In fact, we loved approximately four or five (depending on how you count ‘em) of this week’s guest hosts, though only one of them is our *interim* favorite (hint, hint). So don your pristine nightgown, shuffle whatever papers you’ve got, note that LRB officially has enough passport stories for a future clip show now, and remember: the less you accidentally/on purpose say, the less you accidentally/on purpose regret. Also, we know Eddie is a gentleman in the house and a freak in the streets, but we’re working on it.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Phan Phavorite Phyllis Fletcher takes a break from trust falls and ice breakers with her team in Portland to share not one but TWO TBTL moments from Decembers past! One features Jen (the cake is a lie), one features Luke (who’s too young for a decaf nightcap), and both raise a great question: why did I say that?! While We Have Her™, Phyllis also tells us what it was like in the newsroom on Election Night, from the cliché whiskey to her Reverse Driveway Moment. Plus, Mouth Sounds!</p> <p>Public Service Announcement: This episode features an occasional use of the word “moist,” in relation to Jen’s baking tips. You have been warned. In fact, as an apology, if you’re one of the first 20 people to send and email to littleredbandwagon (at) gmail (dot) com with the word “moist” in the subject line, Christy will send you an LRB sticker as soon as she finishes gagging. Thanks!</p> <p>This episode features TBTL clips from <a href="https://ia800503.us.archive.org/30/items/TBTL.DEC.2008/DEC.08.2008.HR2.mp3">Dec. 8, 2008, hour 2</a> and <a href="https://www.apmpodcasts.org/tbtl/2014/12/crouching-walsh-hidden-doormat/">Dec. 8, 2014, episode 1747</a>.</p>]]>

We kick things off with a Thanksgiving Day Parade of Misery as our worst Turkey Day memories overload the Wappler Doppler in a deluge of disasters from culinary to family—all, of course, punctuated with laughter, and everybody’s favorite imitation turkey gobble.  Then, we move on to a feast of put-ups, because we have no shortage of reasons to be thankful this year! The short list includes an LRB family wedding, a new house, pain relief, outstanding colleagues, a surplus of pie, the Affordable Care Act, the end of a presidency (not the one you’re thinking), and, most of all, our thoughtful and charitable listeners.

Despite their sadness, they manage to address a variety of TBTL topics, including lovesick snails, the handsomest prisoner ever(?), Second Worst American Martin Shkreli and his latest Wu-Tang antics, and the official kombucha of the Seattle Seahawks. In other news, Eddie the dog has made an unexpected transformation, and Meredith and Mike are concerned about Ann’s mental state.</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>Bobby, Ann and Mike dive stump-first into the deep end of the soon-to-be-winterized pool that is the last week of TBTL. We start by searing our hot takes off in several inches olive (but thankfully not sesame) oil, and then slow cook our commentary for several hours in our trusty past-due Crock-Pot®. Mike defends the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Bobby doles out wedding DJ advice, and Ann keeps her frustration at a steady simmer. Overall, it’s a tender but fatty episode, with some <a href="http://www.toppik.com/shop/hair-fiber">overpriced powder</a> filling in the gaps in our lackluster cabbage.</p> <p>Remember: - Subscribe to <a href="http://www.tenseventen.com/eandepod/">Earbuds &amp; Earworms</a>! - Go to <a href="http://littleredbandwagon.com/amazon">littleredbandwagon.com/amazon</a> and order Jesus Creek Mysteries: All The Great Pretenders - Go watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQIPmXmcQPE">this clip from The Newsroom</a> that breaks down the manipulative mastery of Nancy Grace.</p> <p>THANK YOU to everyone who contributed to and shared our recent GoFundMe appeal for Mike and Emily. Thanks to you, we surpassed our goal, and we can go back to mocking Mike without mercy or guilt!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Between the start of Bundt Cake Month in Stickabutter Studios, and a football/birthday party about to start in the Mahan Banquet Center, Ann and Meredith kick off our latest TBTL Week in Review by making Bobby hungry. Appetites, however, are quickly lost thanks to talk about Trump, toilets and the Five-Second Rule—just in time to avoid eating Din Tai Fung leftovers, hotel room coffee and a big bag of Dick’s. But since we don’t want Misha Collins or flea market “Hue” Jackman to think we’re fat, we’ll probably just stick to biting sprinkler water.</p> <p>In her inaugural AnnRant™, Ann reminds us not to be so quick to judge Luke, Andrew (or Matt Damon), and to consider the source before you sharpshoot. Less thoughtfully, Bobby reminds everyone (well, someone anyway) that if TBTL isn’t for you, there are plenty of other podcasts out there.

Christy and Ann are back at it again with the monthly clip show, ready to take a deep dive into the school experiences of Luke, Jen and Andrew, as well as hash out a few of our own educational grievances. We listen in disbelief to some Jesus Creek horror stories, reminisce about school lunches (or the lack thereof), shake our heads at some true “Oh, Andrew” moments, and giggle over Luke’s fashion mishaps. Plus, we start a list of people who’ve got it coming and make the first plans for the LRB book club. It’s going to be a thing, people!</p>]]>

Additionally, Jen laments her fashion choices in the face of physical activity and shares the circumstances under which she got competitive with “European” children. Oh, and everyone should check out Naomi’s podcast, <a href="http://www.thesundaymorningexperience.com/">The Sunday Morning Experience</a>. It’s a fan show about CBS Sunday Morning.

      <itunes:summary>Strap on your FitBit, crack a can of Trader Joe’s wine, and put that cup in your Levi’s—Bobby, Ann and Meredith are rushing animal style to get in their steps while reviewing last week’s TBTL. Daytime Emmy Award Winner Luke got thrown out of a house of worship, feel-good comedy archetype Andrew managed to keep intermediate potty training at arms’ length, someone is wearing a tote bag, and Ann hopes that someone is Kai Ryssdal. Use this episode as a distraction during your Live Show afterglow bath, especially if that’s what it takes to keep you from writing TBTL slash fiction. Reminder: If you haven’t donated to this year’s TBTL-a-Thon yet, stop what you’re doing RIGHT NOW and go to TBTL.net to show your support. Unless you’re currently operating on someone, or flying an airplane. (You know who you are.)</itunes:summary>

First, please ensure that any electronic devices for combating moles are turned off, as they cannot be used in flight. Second, ghost apps are not reliable indicators of spectral activity, so don’t believe the four-star ratings. Third, there will be a surprising amount of MN Twins nostalgia on this flight; remember to drink your cheeseburger-topped Bloody Marys and gently guide your opponent off the bag. Finally, no matter how misty-colored your memories are, those Clark and Lewis radio spots probably aren’t as good as you remember. Please enjoy the trip – it’s our pleasure to serve you!</p>]]>

However, it’s come to our attention that some of you are a bit rusty on your TBTL knowledge, and we’re going to need you to rectify that before we can pass you on to the next grade. Luckily, Ann and Christy are here to teach a refresher course on the history of some important TBTL terms. So grab a #2 pencil and be sure to show your work, because partial answers will get zero credit.</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>Dear Students, The school year is drawing to a close, and we’re about ready to grab our towels and beach reads, grill up some burgers and dogs (hot dogs, that is) and make the most of these dreamy summer days. However, it’s come to our attention that some of you are a bit rusty on your TBTL knowledge, and we’re going to need you to rectify that before we can pass you on to the next grade. Luckily, Ann and Christy are here to teach a refresher course on the history of some important TBTL terms. So grab a #2 pencil and be sure to show your work, because partial answers will get zero credit.</itunes:summary>

We get the lowdown on Detroit pizza, Nick’s TBTL tattoo, and no-fail strategies for romancing the ladies. Then we take a trip down memory lane to a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away (well, to 2012 in the Mt Baker neighborhood of Seattle), and listen to Andrew battle his fear of heights while Luke makes inarticulate sounds of glee with every overhead pass of the famous Blue Angels. <a href="http://www.infiniteguest.org/tbtl/2012/08/blue-angels-live-from-burbank-studios-roof/">Today’s clip originally aired on August 2nd, 2012.</a></p>]]>

We listen back to a TBTL two-fer from 2013 featuring dreams of childhood heroics and a private work bathroom.

        <![CDATA[<p>Apologies in advance for the disparity in sound quality between Christy and Mikes audio, we had to use a backup recording of Mike because his rabbit ate the microphone cord (I wish this was a joke). We turn it up to 11 and dive right into our TBTLisms of the week before recapping episodes 1822-1826 in a collector series. This weeks featured ten is our very own Mike "my rabbit at the microphone" Frizzell and we hear about his former life of crime and things get a little dusty in the little red bandwagon studios before hearing his favorite clip from the TBTL archives. </p>
